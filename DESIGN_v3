Tested for linux kernel 5.15.0-48-generic #121-Ubuntu


- Added support for namespaces
	Files for key and log are open and the file is kept around (and the namespace is not traversed after mount)
		in other words, in the current namespace, the files .SEALFS.LOG  and key (lfile and kfile)
			are found when mounting and the references kept from wherever they were.
	Mount is only possible if you have CAP_SYS_ADMIN
	Files created inside sealfs respect the namespace (as they should). If someone binds something inside,
		some entries will not be there in the file and the verification will fail (a form of attack), but the write
		itself will not fail and the filesystem will behave otherwise as expected. If the same files are bound
		to the right places, the verification will pass (so containers can be composed).

Tested (not too much, but seems to work) with docker. Not everything described above is exercised as
	our use case is quite simple (a volume with sealfs inside docker).
		See tools/docker for more details

- Updated verify for OpenSSL
- Updated support for u-root (now with go mod).

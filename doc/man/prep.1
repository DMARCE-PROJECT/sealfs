.TH PREP 1
.SH NAME
prep \- SealFS log and keystream creation
.SH SYNOPSIS
.BI prep
.BI logfile
.BI kalpha
.BI (kbeta | -p) 
.BI kfilesize
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Prep
initalizes the SealFS log file and creates and fills the keystream files for a SealFS filesystem.
The files created, the log and keystream files, are associated by the same magic number
in their header.

The go version of this tool permits delaying the creation of the kbeta file until
later by passing
.BI -p
flag. With this flag, the kalpha file can be derived from a user  input password.
The kalpha file may be created later, for forensic analysis, as needed, by using the
kpass(1) tool. Note that, while more convenient, this is necessarily less secure.
There are no known attacks present at this time, but it is 
.B theoretically
less secure, so use at your own discretion.

.SH STATUS
Exit status is 0 if the filesystem was created successfully and greater than 0 otherwise.
.SH SOURCE
.B sealfs/tools/prep.c and sealfs/tools/go/cmd/prep

There are two implementations, a C version and a go version. This man page refers to
both.

This todo is now for both C and go (I am keeping them in synch)

More checks to verification:
- Warn if burnt in header != number of records in log
	and compare ncheck. (commit 9bbcb6e compare with
		59ebe76)
	--> done for Go, pending for C

- If there is any discrepancy first FprSize difference in keystream, log where it is
	This is only fakable forward but not backward.

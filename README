This is the first SealFS prototype, based on wrapfs. The module has
been ported to 5.4.0-65 (the first version was for 4.8.17, then 4.15.0, 
see the tags, though some important BUGS have been removed since then).

SealFS is a Linux kernel module that implements a stackable file system
that authenticates the written data to provide tamper-evident logs. It
is based on a forward integrity model: upon exploitation, the attacker
is not able to fake the logs generated before elevating privileges.

When SealFS is mounted on top of another file system, it protects
all the files under the mount point. It only allows append-only write
operations and authenticates the data written to the underlying files
(served by other file system).

If you are interested in the version 1 (SealFSv1) 
described by the paper 
"SealFS: Storage-based tamper-evident logging" 
(https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cose.2021.102325),

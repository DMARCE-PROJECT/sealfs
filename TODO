Write more efficiently (is it possible?)
Run more kthreads (NBURN) reburning the key. Only one of them
	writes the header.
Do not insist on updating header so much when it is not needed.

Better tooling:

A) Solve being able to copy the files and verify elsewhere
	1) Either: rewrite log with different inodes
			or brute force scan looking for entries which verify
			or pass to verify -inode filename
B) Print log files in order with visible mark of whether they are wrong [OK] and or color

Write more efficiently (is it possible?)
Run more kthreads (NBURN) reburning the key. Only one of them
	writes the header.
Do not insist on updating header so much when it is not needed.

Better tooling:

A) Solve being able to copy the files to another FS and verify (maybe continue working) elsewhere
	1) Either: rewrite log with different inodes (good for moving, less versatile)
				rewritelog -2 3 -3 4 -5 650 .SEALFS_log .NEWSEALFS_log
			or brute force scan looking for start with entries which verify (simple for user, less versatile)
				verify -f /var/log/x
			or pass to verify -inode filename (good for scripting)
				verify -12 fich.log
B) Print log files in order (when checkjqueue advances)
with visible mark of whether they are wrong [OK][FAIL] and or color.


RATCHET:
	Add support for ratchet and mixed modes with reseeding.
